# Getting Started with ANT

This guide will help you install, set up, and start using ANT in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (Python 3.12 recommended)
- **Ollama** running locally with a compatible model
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Linux/macOS/WSL** environment

## Installation

### 1. Install Ollama

First, install Ollama if you haven't already:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# On Windows with WSL
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Download a Model

ANT works best with coding-focused models:

```bash
# Recommended: Qwen2.5-Coder (good balance of performance and speed)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b

# Alternative: Smaller model for faster responses
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Or use any compatible model
ollama pull llama2:13b
```

### 3. Clone and Install ANT

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seheart/ant.git
cd ant

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Run Initial Setup

```bash
ant --setup
```

The setup wizard will guide you through:
- Model selection and configuration
- Personality preferences
- User profile setup
- Optional service authentication
