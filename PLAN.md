# ANT - Adaptive Neural Terminal

> Your personal AI assistant that learns and grows with you

## 🎯 Vision

Create a local CLI AI assistant that starts with a base Llama model and continuously evolves to become perfectly tailored to your workflow, preferences, and personality. Think Claude's helpfulness + Cursor's code intelligence + your personal touch, all running locally.

#### Deliverables:
- Project-aware responses
- Code analysis and suggestions
- Multi-file editing capabilities
- Smart context switching

### Phase 3: Learning Pipeline (Week 5-6)
**Goal: Continuous improvement through use**

#### Learning System:
- **Interaction Logging**: Capture conversations, preferences, feedback
- **Rating System**: Like/dislike responses to build training data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn your coding style, preferences, workflows
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data processing for training

#### Deliverables:
- Feedback collection system
- Training data pipeline
- Usage analytics and insights

### Phase 4: Personal Model (Week 7-8)
**Goal: Your personalized AI assistant**

#### Fine-tuning Pipeline:
- **LoRA Training**: Efficient fine-tuning on your data
- **Model Versioning**: Track different versions of your personal model
- **A/B Testing**: Compare base vs fine-tuned performance
- **Continuous Learning**: Regular retraining cycles

#### Deliverables:
- Your first personalized model
- Training pipeline automation
- Performance metrics and comparison

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 9+)
**Goal: Power user capabilities**

#### Advanced Capabilities:
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for new tools
- **Multi-modal**: Handle images, documents, etc.
- **Team Features**: Share learned patterns (if desired)
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Complex multi-step tasks

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Core Technologies:
- **Language**: Python (fast prototyping, great AI libraries)
- **CLI Framework**: Rich (beautiful terminal UI)
- **Model Interface**: Ollama API
- **Database**: SQLite (conversation history, feedback data)
- **Fine-tuning**: Unsloth + LoRA (efficient local training)
- **File Processing**: Tree-sitter (code parsing)
- **Git Integration**: GitPython

### Model Strategy:
- **Base Model**: qwen2.5-coder:14b (already optimized for your system)
- **Fine-tuning**: LoRA adapters (efficient, modular)
- **Fallback**: Smaller models for quick responses
- **Versioning**: Model snapshots for rollbacks

## 🎭 Personality Design

### Core Traits:
- **Helpful**: Proactively offers assistance
- **Curious**: Asks clarifying questions
- **Respectful**: Adapts to your communication style
- **Reliable**: Consistent, predictable behavior
- **Growth-minded**: Learns from mistakes

### Conversation Style:
- Conversational but not overly casual
- Direct when you want efficiency
- Detailed when you need explanation
- Remembers your preferences over time

## 🔄 Learning Methodology

### Data Collection:
- **Implicit**: Usage patterns, command frequency, success rates
- **Explicit**: User ratings, corrections, preferences
- **Contextual**: Project types, coding patterns, time of day

### Training Approach:
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Efficient parameter updates
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn from feedback over time
- **Few-shot Learning**: Adapt quickly to new patterns
- **Regular Retraining**: Weekly/monthly model updates

## 🚀 Getting Started
