‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml         # Main configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conversations.db    # Chat history database
```

### Configuration File Structure

```yaml
# Ollama Model Settings
ollama:
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
  model: "qwen2.5-coder:14b"
  completion_model: "qwen2.5-coder:7b"

# Personality Settings

```

## GitHub Integration

ANT can integrate with your GitHub account for repository management and issue tracking.

### Setup GitHub Authentication

```bash
ant auth github
```

Choose between:
1. **Personal Access Token** (recommended for simplicity)
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Create token with `repo`, `user`, `gist` scopes
   - Enter token when prompted

2. **OAuth Flow** (coming soon)

### GitHub Capabilities

Once authenticated, ANT can:
- Show your GitHub profile info
- List your repositories
- Get repository details and issues
- Access repository information in conversations

Example conversations:
```
You: "Show me my recent repositories"
ANT: [Lists your GitHub repos with details]

You: "What issues are open in my ant project?"
ANT: [Shows open issues from your ant repository]
```

## Google Integration

Basic Google OAuth setup is available for future features.

```bash
ant auth google
```

Currently requires Google Cloud Console setup with OAuth credentials.

## Personality Customization

ANT has three personality modes:

### 1. Helpful Friend (default)
- Friendly and conversational
- Uses casual language
- Encouraging and supportive

### 2. Professional Assistant  
- More formal tone
- Business-like interactions
- Structured responses

### 3. Casual Buddy
- Very informal and relaxed
- Uses slang and emojis
- Playful interactions

Change personality during setup:
```bash
ant --setup
```

## Memory and Context

ANT remembers:
- **Conversation history** - Your chat sessions are saved
- **User preferences** - Communication style, settings
- **System context** - Your username, hostname, shell
- **Authentication** - Connected services and tokens

Memory is stored locally in SQLite database at `~/.ant/conversations.db`.

## Available Tools

ANT has built-in tools that work automatically in conversations:

### DateTime Tools
- Current time and date
- Timezone information
- Time-based responses

### Web Search Tools  
- DuckDuckGo search integration
- News search capabilities
- Real-time information lookup

### GitHub Tools (when authenticated)
- User profile information
- Repository listing and details
- Issue tracking and management

## Tips and Best Practices

### Getting Better Results
1. **Be specific** - ANT works better with clear requests
2. **Use context** - Reference previous conversations
3. **Try different phrasings** - ANT learns from variety
4. **Use tools** - Ask for current information, GitHub data, etc.

### Privacy and Security
- **Local-first** - All conversations stored locally
- **No data sharing** - Your data never leaves your machine
- **Token security** - External service tokens stored securely
- **User control** - You control all authentication and data

### Troubleshooting

#### ANT won't start
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# Check if model is available
ollama list

# Reinstall ANT
pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

#### Authentication issues
```bash
# Check auth status
ant auth status

# Re-authenticate
ant auth revoke github
ant auth github
```

#### Memory issues
```bash
# Clear conversation history
ant
> /clear
```

#### Configuration problems
```bash
# Reset configuration
rm -rf ~/.ant/
ant --setup
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Configuration

Edit `~/.ant/config.yaml` to use different models:

```yaml
ollama:
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
  model: "llama2:13b"           # Change main model
  completion_model: "llama2:7b" # Change completion model
```

### Environment Variables

ANT respects these environment variables:
- `ANT_CONFIG_DIR` - Override config directory (default: `~/.ant`)
- `ANT_OLLAMA_URL` - Override Ollama URL
- `ANT_MODEL` - Override default model
